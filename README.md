This repository contains data and code for [Speed et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1130/G52254.1). Structure-from-motion derived 3-D outcrop meshes are available for download on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/c.speed/models). Lidar data were acquired by the [National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM)](https://ncalm.cive.uh.edu) and are hosted by [OpenTopography](https://portal.opentopography.org/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.052020.6341.1). The `notebooks` folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for reproducing analysis and constructing/visualizing the 3-D stratigraphic model of the avulsion node. Model visualization relies on the [stratigraph](https://github.com/zsylvester/stratigraph) Python package.
